### About Myself:

Hi, I'm Olga and I'm 29 years old. I graduated from Vitebsk State Medical University in 2015 with a degree in pediatrics. But after working as a doctor for several years, I was disappointed to see from the inside how patients treat you. I decided that it was time to change something and try a different life! And I chose programming, since from school times I easily and with interest found a common language with a computer. And now, being at the initial stage of studying a new profession, I see how this process captivates me and enthusiastically "absorb" the information and move on. I am responsible and can work in a team, I have organizational skills (I headed the pediatric department for two years), and always strive to learn something new and strengthen my knowledge.
